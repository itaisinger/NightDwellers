/////////// enemy logic /////////
enemies attack the player either by bumping into them or with attacks. 
if things go well and attacks and hitboxes are well used, remove bumping damage.

// enemy parent object
has a few universal functions:
	hit
	die
	
and a few stats:
	hp
	collide damage

// enemy objects
each has its own state machine and behaviour.


////// enemy spawning logic ////
create a obj_spawner. it will have a few var definition:
	enemy type		which enemy to spawn
	interval		wait time between spawns. -1 to spawn once.
	start level		from which night to start spawning
	spawn chance	the chance for the spawn to not do anything this night
	
then manually place a bunch around the map. or just outside passing through walls the player cant.


///// exp system ////

obj_game has a vars xp_current, xp_required.
xp_required starts at 100.

obj_xp_gem exists. on collide with player, call obj_game.add_xp(xp_amount).
there will be 2 (or 3) xp sizes.

there is a obj_xp_spawner that spawns xp when obj_game calls start_day();
	
	
	
///////// day/night system /////////

obj game has vars: time_elapsed, max_time[<max day time>,<max night time>] and game_state = <0/1>, true means night.
enum TIME{day,night}

in step event obj_game count time_elapsed and when time_elapsed >= max_time[game_state] then call switch_game_state():
	game_state = !game_state
	
	if day
		spawn xp
		despawn monsters
	else
		despawn xp
		activate monster spawners
	
	change bg
